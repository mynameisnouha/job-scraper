-- Run this once in the Supabase SQL editor.
-- Raises the resume-customization threshold from 50 to 70: tailored resumes (1 LLM-heavy
-- generation per run) should only be spent on strong matches. The Python side also guards
-- on config.RESUME_CUSTOMIZATION_MIN_SCORE, but fixing it here stops the RPC from
-- returning 50-69 jobs that would just be skipped.
